PyMsgBox
========

 A simple, cross-platform, pure Python module for JavaScript-like message boxes.

To import, run:

    >>> from pymsgbox import *`

 There are four functions in PyMsgBox, which follow JavaScript's message box naming conventions:

    >>> alert(text='', title='', button='OK')`

    Displays a simple message box with text and a single OK button. Returns the text of the button clicked on.

    >>> confirm(text='', title='', buttons=['OK', 'Cancel'])`

    Displays a message box with OK and Cancel buttons. Number and text of buttons can be customized. Returns the text of the button clicked on.

    >>> prompt(text='', title='' , defaultValue='')`

    Displays a message box with text input, and OK & Cancel buttons. Returns the text entered, or None if Cancel was clicked.

    >>> password(text='', title='', defaultValue='', mask='*')`

    Displays a message box with text input, and OK & Cancel buttons. Typed characters appear as *. Returns the text entered, or None if Cancel was clicked.

On Linux Python 2, you need to first install Tkinter by running: sudo apt-get install python-tk
